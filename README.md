📘 Loan Default Risk Analysis — Tableau Project

This project analyzes customer loan data to identify which factors influence loan defaults.
Using Tableau Public, I created dashboards that visualize patterns based on Income, Credit Score, and Loan Amount.

🎯 Objective

To understand what types of customers are more likely to default on loans, and help financial institutions make data-driven decisions.

🛠 Tools Used

Tableau Public

CSV Dataset

Excel (optional for cleaning)

GitHub for version control

📊 Dashboards Included
1️⃣ Income Group vs Default

Shows which income groups default the most.

Insight:
Low-income customers have the highest default rates.

2️⃣ Credit Score Band vs Default

Analyzes default behavior across 4 credit score categories.

Insight:
Poor credit score (<620) customers default far more than good/excellent score customers.

3️⃣ Loan Amount vs Default

Compares loan amounts of defaulters vs non-defaulters.

Insight:
Loan amount alone does not determine default; income + credit score together matter more.

🧠 Key Insights

Low income + poor credit score = highest risk borrowers

High income + good credit score = low-risk segment

Loan amount has weaker link to default

Credit score is the strongest predictor
